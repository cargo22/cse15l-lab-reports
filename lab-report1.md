## How to Connect to Course-Specific Account 
Hello incoming CSE 15L students,

If you're wondering how to get started on your lab, here's a quick rundown as to how you need to connect to the remote server. 

However, we need to set up your coding environment.

First, you're going to need an interpreter. The one we recommend is VS Code. Download links for all operating systems are found here: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Now, if you're like me and use a Windows machine, you'll need to install Git. The Git install link for Windows users is found here: [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Once you install Git(REMEMBER WINDOWS ONLY), you'll need to set it up in VS Code. Here are a couple steps to set it up:
  1. Open VS Code
  2. Open the terminal (Press ctrl + `)
  3. Open the command pallette by pressing (ctrl + shift + P)
  4. A search bar will appear. Type "Select Default Profile" in the search bar.
  5. Select "Git Bash"
  6. Press the "+" in the terminal (found in the upper right hand corner of the terminal)
  7. You're all set! You can now choose between Bash and Powershell

Now that your VS Code is all set up and ready to go, we will now shift our focus to your course-specific account.
